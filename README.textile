h1. base64_compabile

A drop-in replacement library for Ruby base64 decoding which also decodes improperly padded base64url encoded formats.

h2. Summary

I suggest to only use decode64. Please see this ruby core bug, https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8286 .

h2. Why would I use this?

Use this if you need to decode base64url encoded strings with implicit (not present) padding. This library is much slower than the built-in Base64 library. Once ruby-core adds the correct functionality to MRI Ruby, I suggest use of this library should be discontinued.
